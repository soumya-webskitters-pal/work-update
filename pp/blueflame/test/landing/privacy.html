            <h2 id="tb8">8. Links to other websites</h2>
            <p>The Service may contain links to other websites not operated or controlled by BlueFlame AI, including
                social media services (“Third Party Sites”). The information that you share with Third Party Sites will
                be governed by the specific privacy policies and terms of service of the Third Party Sites and not by

            <p>We implement commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational measures to protect
                Personal Information both online and offline from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure,
                alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or email transmission is ever fully secure or error
                free. In particular, email sent to or from us may not be secure. Therefore, you should take special care
                in deciding what information you send to us via the Service or email. In addition, we are not
                responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Service, or
                third-party websites.</p>
            <p>We’ll retain your Personal Information for only as long as we need in order to provide our Service to
                you, or for other legitimate business purposes such as resolving disputes, safety and security reasons,
                or complying with our legal obligations. How long we retain Personal Information will depend on a number
                of factors, such as the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the information, the potential risk of harm
                from unauthorized use or disclosure, our purpose for processing the information, and any legal
                requirements.</p>
